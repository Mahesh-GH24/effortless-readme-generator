## Description

It takes a quite bit of time to write a thorough README.md file and sometimes its possible to miss out an important section which would be required for effective colloboration with other contributors. This app prompts the user with a series of questions and builds a powerful & formatted README.md file in no time.

## Future Implementation
Upgrade the command line application to user friendly front end application using React
